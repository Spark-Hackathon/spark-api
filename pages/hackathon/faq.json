			"description": "A Hackathon is an event where people come together to collaborate on creating tech that solve real-world problems. Saturday evening, you will hear from local companies and organizations about a problem they need help solving. Then you will choose one to work on and form teams. Sunday will be spent 'hacking' a solution. At the end of the day, teams will present their projects to the community at a Demo Party!"
